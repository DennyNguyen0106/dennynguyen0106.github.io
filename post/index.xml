      <description>So. I bet everything I owned on the NCAA tournament based on what my model told me and I am now homeless. The Colgate-Iowa final did not happen. But while I did lose everything, I learned some valuable lessons.
The most surprising thing about this whole process was that I was somehow not last. I know what you&amp;rsquo;re thinking, &amp;ldquo;you picked Colgate-Iowa for your final and you still didn&amp;rsquo;t get last?</description>

      <description>The greatest thing about my current job is that it does not allow me to bet money on college sports. If I were able to bet on March Madness, I would be in serious debt.
I don’t claim to be a basketball genius, but I certainly wouldn’t say that I have no idea what I’m doing when filling out an NCAA Tournament bracket. When I’m picking my teams, I can back up my picks with solid reasoning.</description>
